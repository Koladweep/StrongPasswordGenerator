# StrongPasswordGenerator
A simple Python script to generate random passwords of random length in  specified range. It uses python libraries like secret and random and All ASCII punctuatino, digits and Alphabet(US English) to generate passwords and avoids clustering and adjacant repetition.
I am a python enthusiast and I write code. I however prefer Ideas more than the implementation itself. this project came out unplanned and still is pretty awesome and is an example of how AI can do wonders if done in a more planned way.
The passwords generated by this code are scoring 4 in zxcvbn test.
I had an Idea and quickly made this code using the algorithm. of course with help of OpenAI GPT 3.5
