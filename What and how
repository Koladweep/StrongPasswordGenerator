This project started as a conversation with ChatGPT about brute forcing and I wanted to test the strength of my password generated by MSEdge.
My request to get a code snippet got blocked by chatGPT with a polite denial to not comply with inappropriate requests. 
I proceeded to narrate the algorithm for bruteforcing and explained that I am not interested in impractical stuff and expalained what I wanted.
What went on as a conversation evolved into an idea and finally I was finetuning the knowledge it provided in an IDLE shell. 


Outcome:
I learnt about built in modules in python that are not as predictable as the pseudorandom selector module called 'random'
Also I learnt the potential of AI. If this were a planned endeavour, much more could have been achieved.


Conclusion:
I plan to incorporate more of such resources into my learning process, especially in the implementation part.

Disclaimer:
Even elliptic curve cryptography is being considered inadequate in post quantum computer era. So please research well before incorporating this code into your projects. Security is to be taken seriously and better solutions exist.
There are better ways to generate stronger passwords. I am no expert and Better libraries exist.
